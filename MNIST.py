# Your task is to write a Python program that loads the digits data set, initializes a
# model that is an instance of the sklearn.linear_model.SGDClassifier class, and
# then carries out 50 stochastic gradient descent training iterations, as follows. In each
# iteration, a random subset of 100 data examples (rows of the data set) should be
# selected via the random.choices function; the SGDClassifier.partial_fit method
# should then be used to train the model, using only the mini-batch consisting of the
# 100 data rows selected in that iteration, together with their target labels (once youâ€™ve
# obtained the row numbers to use from choices and placed them in indices, say, you
# can just use the syntax A[indices,:] to extract the corresponding rows of A).
# Use the SGDClassifier.score method to keep track of the classification accuracy of
# the model relative to the entire data set at the end of each training iteration. Report the
# 50 accuracy scores obtained during the whole training procedure (one per iteration).
# Plot the accuracy as a function of the cumulative number of training iterations. You
# may use matplotlib.pyplot.plot and matplotlib.pyplot.show for this purpose.
# Study the online documentation. Submit your code and results.
